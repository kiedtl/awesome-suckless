A curated list of awesome suckless software and libraries.

**Suckless software**, according to [suckless.org](https://suckless.org), is defined as any application or library with a focus on simplicity, clarity, and frugality.
Such software is simple in implementation, simple to maintain, and (to advanced users) simple to use. Many suckless tools are packaged with a minimal set of features.
